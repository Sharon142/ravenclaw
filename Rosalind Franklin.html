        <h1>Rosalind Franklin</h1><br>
        <h2><b><u>Summary</u></b></h2><br>
        <p>Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born on July 25 1920 in London, England.  Rosalind Franklin<br>
           died on April 16, 1958 London.  She was a British scientist and a chemist known for her<br> 
           discovery of the molecular structure of DNA.  Franklin also gave a new insight to the<br>
           structure of viruses which helped to build foundation of the virology structure.  Franklin attended<br>
           St Paul's Girls' College before pursuing her studies in physical chemistry at the University of<br>
           Cambridge.  Franklin graduated in 1941 and received a companionship to research in physical chemistry.<br>
           The following year, Franklin became an air-raid warden due to World War II and used this opportunity to<br>
           investigate the physical chemistry between carbon and coal.  Franklin joined the Biophysical Laboratory in<br>
           King's College 1951 to conduct a research study on DNA using X-ray diffraction methods.  This successfully<br>
           helped her discover the structure of DNA.

        <h2><b><u>Discovery of DNA and the structure of viruses</u></b></h2><br>
        <p>Brenda Maddow referred to Rosalind Franklin as “The Dark Lady of DNA” due to the lack of recognition<br>
           she received.  Franklin moved to Paris in 1946 to perfect her skills in X-ray crystallography.  She loved<br>
           the freedom and lifestyle in Paris but she moved back to London to accept her job at King’s College.  During<br>
           her life, Rosalind Franklin was hardworking and a bold traveler who loves the outdoors and hiking.  Franklin<br> 
           enjoys a vibrant discussion on science and politics.  Rosalind Franklin’s friends and colleagues considered<br>
           her as a kindhearted, brilliant, short-tempered, and stubborn woman.  Maurice Wilkins was one of her colleagues<br>
           who considered her a challenge to work with.   
        </p><br>
        <p>A misunderstanding occurred between Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, causing immediate friction and making<br>
           them work in isolated environments.  It was unknown to Rosalind Franklin that Maurice Wilkins showed James Watson<br>
           and Francis Crick Franklin’s work.  They never acknowledged Franklin’s work, only after Rosalind Franklin’s death<br>
           Crick acknowledged her contributions.  In his letter, Crick has stated that Rosalind Franklin’s contributions had<br>
           been vital for the discovery of DNA and their Noble Prize award. </p><br>
        <p>Around this time Rosalind Franklin left King’s College for the Birkbeck College crystallography laboratory.  Franklin<br>
           studied the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus where she became successful and was asked to create virus models to<br>
           display at the 1958 Brussels World’s Fair Science Exhibition.  Franklin died at 38 due to ovarian cancer (few years<br>
           before Wilkins, Watson, and Crick received the Noble Prize Award).  The inscription on her tombstone states: “Her work on<br>
           viruses was a lasting benefit to mankind”.  Her reputation and her legacy grew and spread.  This creates a rise in the<br>
           feminist movement and a strong response to James Watson’s portrayal which is a memoir called “The Double Helix”.<br>
           Despite missing out on an award, Rosalind Franklin’s name is remembered through awards, science institutes, and a university<br>
           in Chicago.  Franklin’s legacy will continue to extend in space where a space rover in Mars will be named after her.</p><br>
        <p>Sadly, the credit goes to James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins for the Noble Prize 1962.  Only a letter<br>
           written by Crick "the data which really helped us to obtain the structure was mainly obtained by Rosalind Franklin."<br>
           The reason she did not get the Noble Prize was because she did not get along with Maurice Wilkins (her colleague) while<br>
           they were working to uncover the structure of the DNA.  However, they made a lot of progress.  In May 1952, she took a<br>
           photograph of the famous DNA structure (photograph 51).  James Watson and Francis Crick stole her data and published it as<br>
           their own work through "a paper in Nature" and only credited Franklin and Wilkins as their helpers.  The reason we know this<br>
           is because Watson himself have cheerfully described his actions were burglary.  Maurice Wilkins regretted his actions and he <br>
           was angry with James Watson and Francis Crick but Watson said that this was a wakeup call and Wilkins should not be so upset because<br>
           they were only friends. </p>
